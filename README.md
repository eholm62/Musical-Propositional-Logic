## What is this project about? 
In 2023, my AP Computer Science A teacher quickly introduced the class to
propositional logic in order to give us a better understanding of boolean 
expressions in Java. One major part of propositional logic we discussed 
was the construction of truth tables. If you're unfamiliar, truth tables
display every possible combination of truth values assigned to the atomic
statements in the expression, and what each of those combinations yields
as the value of the whole expression.

For example, if you have the atomic statments **P** and **Q**, and the 
proposition **P v Q** (read as "P or Q"), you can construct the truth table for that 
proposition like so. First, order the atomic statements alphabetically.
